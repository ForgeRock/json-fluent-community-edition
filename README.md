# json-fluent - Community Edition

This repository contains code used to build the json-fluent.jar used by the OpenAM, OpenDJ, OpenIDM and OpenIG Community edition projects.

## About

The ce/<version no> tags may be used to pull the code used to generate the jars used by the community edition projects. There are no jar files associated with the releases as all the Community Edition binary artifacts are made available via ForgeRock's [Maven Community Repository](http://maven.forgerock.org/repo/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/community).
