/**
 * Provides a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface">fluent</a> API for the
 * traversal and manipulation of JSON object model structures in Java.
 * <p>
 * Unlike typical Java JSON libraries, JSON-Fluent is not involved in the serial
 * representation of JSON; rather, it focuses exclusively on processing Java structures
 * composed of {@code Map}, {@code List}, {@code String}, {@code Number} and {@code Boolean}
 * objects.
